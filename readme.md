__Special thanks to Olrak__ for his work on the P8 Lite sources  
__Special thanks to lloco__ for fixing the WiFi issue  

## Cyanogenmod Compatible Kernel Sources
These sources fix the Android.mk issue (build_script.sh won't be created) and adds support for ARM 64 sigcontext which caused Alsa libraries compilation to fail.  

Furthermore, some stock governers are reenabled and SeLinux boot time changing support is added.
